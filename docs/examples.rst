For certain proof of concepts, we provide Jupyter notebooks, which require
additional dependencies to be installed. This is described in our
`INSTALL guide <https://zema-emc-annotated.readthedocs.io/en/latest/INSTALL.html#optional-jupyter-notebook-dependencies>`_
After executing the necessary command, you can browser through the following list but
more importantly, check out the core class
`ZeMASamples <https://zema-emc-annotated.readthedocs.io/en/latest/zema_emc_annotated.dataset.html#zema_emc_annotated.dataset.ZeMASamples to get the samples in>`_.
